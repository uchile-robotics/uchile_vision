depthimage_to_laserscan
=======================

Modified version of the official depthimage_to_laserscan ROS package

Converts a depth image to a laser scan for use with navigation and localization.
Obstacles are detected in  a corridor between a lower threshold and an upper threshold.
The precision of the conversion can be adjusted according to the available computing power.

In the future methods to use this package and the original depthimage_to_laserscan in parallel will be implemented.
